<h2> Music :: Language :: Theatre
</h2>

<p>
After studying <strong>conducting and music history</strong> at Harvard, along with a specialization in <strong>Romance languages,</strong> I embarked on a solo singing career. 
</p>
<p>Boston University and the Longy School of Music of Bard College helped me focus my musical passion on <strong>opera performance,</strong> through two graduate degrees and four additional years of study. I then traveled across the country and internationally, honing my skills as a <strong>musician and linguist</strong>, and apprenticing myself to a new art, <strong>stagecraft.</strong>

</p>
<p>
Drawing on this wealth of experience from academic and performance environments&#8212;plus the third dimension of <strong>theatre</strong>&#8212;I have developed a dynamic teaching method that cultivates the unique mix of music-making gifts every student naturally possesses. My deep experience learning five foreign languages also greatly influences my work.
</p>
<p>
I now teach languages and <strong><u>music as a language</u></strong>, to students aged 4 to 80. With a background in <strong>Music Together,</strong> an early childhood music and movement program, I have developed a special ability to reach younger learners and lead them in their first formal explorations of music at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>Each of my 35+ current students, whether school-age or adult, learns in a unique way. My far-ranging voyages of discovery into music, language, and theatre have prepared me to be an ideal instructor for the beginner or advanced learner &#8212; at the keys, at the mic, or on the opera or musical theatre stage.
               </p>
