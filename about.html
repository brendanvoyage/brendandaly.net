<p>
Cologne-based tenor Brendan Daly has sung a wide range of roles across the US and internationally, specializing in Mozart, Italian bel canto, operetta, and contemporary works.
</p>
<p>
Brendan is a proud member of the Don Pasquale cast who took home the prestegious 2017 Ring Award in Graz, Austria this past summer. In other recent bel canto adventures, he had the amazing privilege to sing Argirio in Rossini's Tancredi for the Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance in Nova Scotia, under the direction of legendary Rossini expert Maestro Alberto Zedda. Brendan's participation in this concert performance of one of the composer's grandest serious operas came about through his participation in the Accademia Rossiniana at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Italy.
</p>
<p>
2016 was a busy year of travel, intensive language study, and performances, traversing repertoire from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, on tour with Atlanta Opera, to Puccini's Messa di Gloria in New Hampshire, with the Clearlakes Chorale and Orchestra. The year rounded out with Candide and West Side Story scenes, in a Leonard Bernstein / American opera night in Berlin.
</p>
<p>
Brendan was also in Canada in March 2015 for a five-week residency of song and opera performances with the Lunenburg Academy. He then returned to Opera on the James in Lynchburg, Virginia, for a Baroque and Beyond program, before heading to Boston to cover Lionel in Boston Midsummer Opera's Martha.
</p>
<p>
While engaged at the Boston University Opera Institute in 2013, Brendan made his professional opera debut with Opera Saratoga, performing lead roles in Offenbach’s Le 66, Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury, and William Schuman's The Mighty Casey.
</p>
<p>
Other recent credits include supporting roles with Atlanta Opera (La Bohème), Atlanta Ballet (Carmina Burana), Opera Saratoga (Die Fledermaus), Opera Boston (Mahagonny), and Opera Colorado, where he apprenticed two seasons.
On the Denver main stage, Brendan sang Nathanael / Tales of Hoffmann and Almaviva / Barber of Seville, in a matinee performance with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. He also covered Ferrando in Cos&#236; fan tutte and toured the region as Don Ramiro in Rossini's La Cenerentola, Ivan in Richard Wargo's The Music Shop, and Romeo in Gounod's Romeo and Juliet.
</p>
<p>
A Young Artist in previous seasons at Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Tanglewood, Aspen, Opera Saratoga, and Opera on the James, Brendan earned his BA in Romance Languages and Literatures and Music from Harvard and his Master’s from the Longy School of Music.
