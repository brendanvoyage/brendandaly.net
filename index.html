              <p>In the sixth century, Saint Brendan the Navigator sailed the northern seas. Legend holds that he and his mission may have gotten as far as the New World.</p>

            <p>Inspired by that adventure, I continue my own voyage of discovery into music, languages, movement, and highly physical drama, as I strive for the truest, most fully embodied characterization that I can bring to the live stage.<br />

            "Tenor Brendan Daly sang with stellar purity, and Heggie painted vividly with cascading thirds on the keyboard. In a complete about-face, the same performers gave an intensely dramatic rendering of "Incantation Bowl" (Gene Scheer), enhanced by Nathan Troup's twitchy, obsessive staging."

            "Brendan Daly sang the role of Tiberge in style. Acting as a mediator between the clashing mindsets of Jean and Des Grieux, Daly kept the role cheery, while not making too light of it either. Tiberge's witty scheme of fashioning Aurore to the likeness of Manon prove him sly, but his genuine concern for Des Grieux temper this sly character. Daly's French diction was particularly impressive..."

            "Vocally, I was particularly impressed by...Brendan Daly as Lechmere in the opening scene, the one place where Britten allows us a sense of fun and joy--one could almost understand why one would want to be a soldier by seeing the pure joy Lechmere brings to brandishing a sword."

McGlaun and Brendan Daly, who gave amusingly characterized and well-sung performances as Helene, Robert and the Bearded Sage.
